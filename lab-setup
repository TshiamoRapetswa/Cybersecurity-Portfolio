## 🧪 Lab Setup: Windows 10 Virtual Environment

This module lays the foundation for my SOC readiness lab by setting up a controlled Windows 10 environment using Oracle VirtualBox. The goal was to create a stable workspace for practicing OS-level tasks and exploring system behavior from a defender’s perspective.

### 🔧 What I Did

- Installed **Windows 10** on Oracle VirtualBox
- Configured:
  - **Hostname** for system identification
  - **User account** with appropriate privileges
  - **Networking settings** to enable internet access and local connectivity
- Explored the Windows workspace:
  - **Desktop environment**
  - **Taskbar and system tray**
  - **File Explorer** structure and navigation

### 🎯 Why It Matters for SOC Readiness

- 🖥️ **Familiarity with the OS**  
  Understanding the layout and behavior of Windows is essential for detecting anomalies and navigating logs.

- 🌐 **Networking setup**  
  Ensures the VM can simulate real-world connectivity—critical for testing firewall rules, DNS behavior, and endpoint visibility.

- 👤 **User account configuration**  
  Helps reinforce concepts like privilege separation, user profiles, and access control.

This setup acts as the launchpad for deeper exercises in log analysis, system monitoring, and threat detection—all within a safe, isolated lab.
